# Bus Lateness Predictor and Visualizer
A machine learning Project for DandyHacks Hackathon. Uses the Rochester bus arrival data to predict the percentage of on-time arrivals for different bus companies for different months of the year. Used a simple linear regression model using the scikit learn library. After getting the predictions, different bus stations are colored green or red on Google Maps depending on how likely they are to arrive on time. This mapping is done using the Google Maps Api and JavaScript.

Future plans for this project include highlighting different routes green or red depending on the likelihood of on-time arrivals and making the web app interactive.

This project was done in collaboration with Edwin Hung
